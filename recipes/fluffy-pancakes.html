    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul class="description">
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar or to taste</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups milk or as needed</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol class="description">
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk milk, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the wet mixture. Gently stir the batter until just combined, the batter should be slightly lumpy.</li>
        <li>Preheat a griddle or frying pan over medium heat (or to 350°F). Lightly grease with butter or vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>Pour about ¼ cup of batter onto the heated griddle for each pancake. Cook on one side until bubbles form and begin to pop, about 2 minutes. Flip the pancakes over and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until both sides are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked pancakes to a serving plate or a warmed oven and repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
